FC26 Match Tracker - Product Requirements Document
Overview
A lightweight, self-hosted web application for tracking 1v1 FIFA FC26 match results among colleagues. The app records match outcomes, maintains player statistics, and displays a leaderboard to encourage friendly competition.
Problem Statement
Daily FC26 matches at work have no way to track who's winning or losing over time. Without historical records, matches lack the competitive edge that comes from tracked standings and bragging rights.
